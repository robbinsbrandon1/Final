<h1>About Us</h1>
<img src = 'photo1.png'>
<p>
  Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
  North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
  years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
  that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
  with our modern mobile food truck.

  This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
  paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
  mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
  11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
  11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
  difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
  Curbside Thai will deliver.

  Contact us to cater your next party and experience
  what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food
  on or off the streets of Charlotte.
